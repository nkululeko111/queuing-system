# booking-system

this system uses real time data
it a system that must must be integrated with another in-house system
the system allows people to queue at the confort of their homes while
waiting fo their turn. they frequently get notification as the 
queue is actively moving. 



 step-by-step guide to creating a real-time queue tracking system in Python:

1. **Define the Queue Structure**: You can use a list or a deque (from the collections module) to represent the queue. Each element in the queue could be a dictionary representing a customer, with details like their name and queue number.

2. **Add Customers to the Queue**: When a new customer joins the queue, append them to the end of the list or deque. You can increment a counter each time to give each customer a unique queue number.

3. **Create a Notification System**: akes a customer as input and prints a message indicating their current position in the queue. This function should be called whenever the queue is updated.

4. **Serve Customers**: When a customer is served, remove them from the front of the queue (using the `pop` method if you're using a list, or the `popleft` method if you're using a deque). Then, call the notification function for each remaining customer in the queue to update them on their new position.

5. **Real-Time Tracking**: To simulate real-time tracking, 

6. **User Interface**: a user interface (UI) for this system. This could be a simple text interface in the console, or a more complex graphical interface using a library like tkinter or PyQt.

7. **Error Handling**: appropriate error handling. 
8. **Testing**: tests system to ensure it works correctly under a variety of conditions.
